# Module #2: JavaScript Fundamentals for React

## JavaScript Advanced OOP: Private Variables, Mixins & Inheritance

Topics

- JavaScript class has no access modifiers (like private, public, protected)
- Private members are marked using `#`
- Inheritance
  - Multiple inheritance not allowed
  - Multi-level inheritance allowed
- Mixins

In modern JavaScript (ECMAScript 2022 and later), you specify private members  
(fields, methods, getters, and setters) within a class using a hash `#` prefix  
on the member's name. This provides true privacy that is enforced by the language,  
making the members inaccessible from outside the class or from subclasses.  

**Using the Hash # Prefix**  

The hash `#` prefix  makes the member only accessible within the class body  
where it is defined.  

* Private Fields: Declared in the class body with a hash `#` prefix.  
* Private Methods: Defined like regular methods, but with a hash `#` prefix.  

Here is an example demonstrating private fields and methods:  

```javascript
class Circle {
  #radius; // Private field declaration

  constructor(value) {
    this.#radius = value; // Accessible within the class
  }

  #calculateArea() { // Private method
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(this.#radius, 2);
  }

  get area() { // Public getter to access private data
    return this.#calculateArea();
  }
}

const circle = new Circle(10);
console.log(circle.area); // 314.159... (Access via public getter)

// Attempting to access private members from outside the class results in an error
// console.log(circle.#radius); // SyntaxError
// console.log(circle.#calculateArea()); // SyntaxError
```

Key Characteristics of Private Members 

* Language Enforced Privacy: Unlike the convention of using an underscore prefix,  
which is merely a hint to other developers, the `#` syntax is strictly enforced by the JavaScript runtime.  
* Accessibility: Private members can only be accessed using dot notation (`this.#memberName`) within the class that defines them.  
* No Inheritance: Private members are not inherited by subclasses. A subclass cannot access a private member of its superclass.  
• Static Privates: You can also define private static fields and methods using the `static #` syntax.
