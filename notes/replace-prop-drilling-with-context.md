# Replace prop drilling with context

## What is prop drilling?

Prop drilling is a term used to describe the process of passing data from a higher-level component to a lower-level component through multiple layers of intermediate components. This often leads to unnecessary complexity and makes the code harder to maintain.

When you find that you are passing the same props through many levels of a component tree, it may be a good time to consider using context to avoid prop drilling.

same props passed through multiple levels of the component tree - from top-level component to deeply nested child component

## Using Context to Avoid Prop Drilling

Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

Top-level component provides the context value using `createContext`, and any nested component can access that value directly using the `useContext` hook.

`createContext` lets you create a Context object.
`useContext` is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

## Example

**With Prop Drilling**  

In this example, the `imageSize` prop is passed down through multiple components (`App` -> `List` -> `Place` -> `PlaceImage`).

It is required by the `PlaceImage` component to determine the size of the images displayed.
No other component in the hierarchy needs this prop, but they still have to accept and pass it down.

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState } from 'react';
import { places } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function App() {
  const [isLarge, setIsLarge] = useState(false);
  const imageSize = isLarge ? 150 : 100;
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isLarge}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsLarge(e.target.checked);
          }}
        />
        Use large images
      </label>
      <hr />
      <List imageSize={imageSize} />
    </>
  )
}

function List({ imageSize }) {
  const listItems = places.map(place =>
    <li key={place.id}>
      <Place
        place={place}
        imageSize={imageSize}
      />
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}

function Place({ place, imageSize }) {
  return (
    <>
      <PlaceImage
        place={place}
        imageSize={imageSize}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{place.name}</b>
        {': ' + place.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

function PlaceImage({ place, imageSize }) {
  return (
    <img
      src={getImageUrl(place)}
      alt={place.name}
      width={imageSize}
      height={imageSize}
    />
  );
}

// data.js
export const places = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Bo-Kaap in Cape Town, South Africa',
  description: 'The tradition of choosing bright colors for houses began in the late 20th century.',
  imageId: 'K9HVAGH'

}];

// utils.js
export function getImageUrl(place) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    place.imageId +
    'l.jpg'
  );
}
```

**Using Context to Avoid Prop Drilling**  

In this example, we create an `ImageSizeContext` using `createContext` and provide the `imageSize` value at the top level using `ImageSizeContext.Provider`.  

The `PlaceImage` component can then access the `imageSize` value directly using the `useContext` hook, without needing to receive it as a prop.

```jsx
// App.js
import { useState, useContext } from 'react';
import { places } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';
import { ImageSizeContext } from './context.js';

export default function App() {
  const [isLarge, setIsLarge] = useState(false);
  const imageSize = isLarge ? 150 : 100;

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        <input
          type="checkbox"
          checked={isLarge}
          onChange={e => {
            setIsLarge(e.target.checked);
          }}
        />
        Use large images
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ImageSizeContext.Provider value={imageSize}>
        <List />
      </ImageSizeContext.Provider>
    </>
  )
}

function List() {
  const listItems = places.map(place =>
    <li key={place.id}>
      <Place
        place={place}
      />
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}

function Place({ place }) {
  return (
    <>
      <PlaceImage
        place={place}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{place.name}</b>
        {': ' + place.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}

function PlaceImage({ place }) {
  const imageSize = useContext(ImageSizeContext);
  return (
    <img
      src={getImageUrl(place)}
      alt={place.name}
      width={imageSize}
      height={imageSize}
    />
  );
}

// context.js
import { createContext } from 'react';
export const ImageSizeContext = createContext(100);

// data.js
export const places = [{
