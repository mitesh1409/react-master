# React Master > React is Declarative

What is "Declarative"?

* **Declarative**: "What should be done?"
We just tell what needs to be done,
we don't need to worry about how it will be done.
It is like giving an order for what to do without worrying about how it will be done.

* **Imperative**: "How should it be done?"
We give step by step instructions for what to do.

For a code example check [Challenge #4](/challenges/challenge-4.md)
