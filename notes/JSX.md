Before JSX
React.createElement

Think about nested elements.

Hard to write, maintain such code.
It is not declarative.

Birth of JSX
Declarative, HTML like syntax.
Allows to embed JavaScript code whenever required.
Easy to learn, readable, maintainable.

JSX is syntactic sugar, at the end it is converted to JavaScript code.

If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an [online converter](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx).
