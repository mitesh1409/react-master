# How to manage component specific state in functional components?

Use `useState` hook.

---

## Core Idea

`useState` allows a functional component to:

* store its own state,
* update that state,
* automatically re-render when the state changes.

---

## Basic Syntax

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

* `state` → current state value
* `setState` → function to update the state
* `initialValue` → initial state when the component first renders

---

## Example: Counter Component

This example demonstrates component-specific state that exists **only inside this component**.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

---

## How This Works

1. `useState(0)` initializes `count` with `0`
2. Clicking the button calls `setCount`
3. React updates the state and re-renders the component
4. The updated value is shown in the UI

---

## Key Points for Interviews

* `useState` manages **component-specific (local) state**
* State is preserved between renders
* Updating state triggers a re-render
* Each component instance has its **own independent state**
