# What is JSX?

## What is JSX?

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension to JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write **UI code using an HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript**, which React then converts into standard JavaScript function calls.

JSX is **not HTML** and **not a template language**—it is syntactic sugar for `React.createElement()`.

## Key Characteristics of JSX

### 1. HTML-like Markup (but not HTML)

JSX *looks* like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript.

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello</h1>;
```

This is compiled to:

```js
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

Important differences from HTML:

* `className` instead of `class`
* `htmlFor` instead of `for`
* CamelCase for attributes (`onClick`, `tabIndex`)

---

### 2. Declarative Syntax

JSX is **declarative**, meaning you describe *what the UI should look like*, not *how to update it*.

```jsx
{isLoggedIn && <Dashboard />}
```

React decides when and how to update the DOM based on state changes.

---

### 3. JavaScript Expressions Inside `{ }`

You can embed **any JavaScript expression** inside curly braces.

```jsx
const name = "Mitesh";
<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
```

Valid inside `{}`:

* Variables
* Function calls
* Ternary expressions
* Logical expressions (`&&`)

Invalid inside `{}`:

* `if`, `for`, `while` statements (use expressions instead)

---

### 4. Must Return a Single Root Element

JSX must return **one parent/root element**, but this does **not** mean only one visible DOM node.

Valid approaches:

```jsx
// Using a wrapper div
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Text</p>
  </div>
);
```

```jsx
// Using React Fragment (preferred)
return (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Text</p>
  </>
);
```

Fragments let you return multiple elements **without adding extra DOM nodes**.

## Additional Important Points (Often Asked in Interviews)

### JSX is Optional

You can write React without JSX:

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello");
```

JSX just makes the code more readable and maintainable.

---

### JSX Requires Compilation

Browsers do **not** understand JSX directly.

Tools like:

* Babel
* Vite
* Webpack

compile JSX into plain JavaScript.

---

### JSX Helps Prevent XSS

JSX automatically escapes values embedded in `{}`:

```jsx
<h1>{userInput}</h1>
```

This prevents injection attacks by default.
