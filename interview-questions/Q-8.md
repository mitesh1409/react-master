# What is the core concept behind React's "reconcilliation" process?

Comparing the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM to efficiently update the UI.

**reconcilliation meaning**  
A situation in which two or more people resolve their differences  
and restore a friendly relationship.

## Core Concept of React Reconciliation

**Reconciliation** is the process by which **React determines the minimum set of changes needed to update the Real DOM when state or props change**.

In simple terms:

> React **compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM**, figures out what has changed, and then **efficiently updates only those parts of the Real DOM**.

## Important Clarification

It is a common misconception that React directly compares the Virtual DOM with the Real DOM.

**What actually happens:**

1. State or props change
2. React creates a **new Virtual DOM tree**
3. React **diffs** (compares) the **new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM**
4. React computes the minimal updates
5. Only those updates are applied to the **Real DOM**

## Why Reconciliation Is Important

* Direct DOM updates are slow
* Virtual DOM comparisons are fast
* Reconciliation ensures:

  * Better performance
  * Predictable UI updates
  * Efficient rendering

## Interview-Ready One-Line Answer

> React reconciliation is the process of comparing the previous and new Virtual DOM trees to determine the most efficient way to update the Real DOM.

## Meaning of “Reconciliation”

Just like the dictionary meaning—**resolving differences and restoring harmony**—
React reconciliation **resolves differences between UI states** and brings the DOM back into sync with the latest state.
