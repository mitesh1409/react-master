# What is the purpose of `StrictMode` component in React?

To highlight potential problems and deprecated practices in development mode.

```javascript
// main.jsx file

import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App.jsx'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

## Purpose of `StrictMode` in React

`StrictMode` is a **development-only** helper component that helps you find **potential problems and unsafe patterns** in your React application early.

It **does not affect production builds**.

---

## What `StrictMode` Does

When enabled, React performs extra checks to:

* Highlight **deprecated APIs and lifecycle methods**
* Detect **unsafe side effects**
* Warn about **legacy string refs**
* Identify **unexpected mutations**
* Help prepare your code for **future React features**

---

## Important Behavior (React 18+)

In **development mode**, `StrictMode` will:

* **Intentionally run certain lifecycle methods and hooks twice**
  (e.g., `useEffect`, component render)

This is done to:

* Expose side effects that are **not properly cleaned up**
* Encourage **pure, predictable components**

> This double invocation happens **only in development**, not in production.

---

## Key Points to Remember

* Used only for **development diagnostics**
* Produces **warnings only** (no runtime errors)
* Does **not render any UI**
* Safe to keep enabled in all environments

---

> `StrictMode` helps identify potential problems, unsafe side effects, and deprecated practices in a React application during development, without affecting production behavior.
