# What is the significance of the key prop in React lists?

The `key` prop is a special attribute used by React to uniquely identify elements in a list. It helps React determine **which items have been added, updated, reordered, or removed** between renders.

By using stable and unique keys, React can perform its **reconciliation (diffing) process** efficiently, updating only the affected components instead of re-rendering the entire list. This improves both **performance** and **correctness of UI updates**.

### Important Points

* Keys must be **unique among siblings**
* Keys should be **stable** (should not change between renders)
* Avoid using array indexes as keys when the list can change order, add, or remove items

## Simple Code Example

### ❌ Without `key` (or with index as key)

```jsx
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Problem:**
If items are inserted or removed, React may reuse the wrong DOM elements, leading to unexpected UI behavior.

### ✅ With Proper `key`

```jsx
function TodoList({ todos }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <li key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

**Why this works:**

* `todo.id` is unique and stable
* React can correctly track each list item across renders

## One-Line Summary (Interview Friendly)

> The `key` prop uniquely identifies list elements so React can efficiently and correctly update only the changed items during re-rendering.
