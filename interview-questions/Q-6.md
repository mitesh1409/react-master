# What are the ways we can pass data from a parent component to a child component in React?

In React, **data is passed from a parent component to a child component mainly using *props***.  
This is the standard and recommended approach.

---

## 1. Passing Data via Props (Most Common)

The parent sends data as attributes, and the child receives it as `props`.

### Parent Component

```jsx
function Parent() {
  return <Child greetings="Hello :)" />;
}
```

### Child Component

```jsx
function Child(props) {
  return <h2>From Parent: {props.greetings}</h2>;
}
```

**How it works**

* `greetings="Hello :)"` is passed from `Parent`
* `Child` receives it using `props.greetings`

## 2. Passing Functions via Props (To Send Data Back to Parent)

You can also pass a function as a prop.

### Parent Component

```jsx
function Parent() {
  const showMessage = (msg) => {
    alert(msg);
  };

  return <Child onClick={showMessage} />;
}
```

### Child Component

```jsx
function Child({ onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={() => onClick("Hello from Child")}>Click</button>;
}
```

## Key Points

* **Props are read-only**
* Data flow is **one-way**: Parent ➝ Child
